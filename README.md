# <Snake/>

This is a classic game of Snake made using React!
It uses [React Konva](https://github.com/lavrton/react-konva) to easily interact with Canvas elements.

Clicking or Tapping on the screen acts like pressing the start button.

You can either use the buttons on the console or the following keys:

  - Up Arrow or W
  - Left Arrow or A
  - Down Arrow or S
  - Right Arrow or D
  - Spacebar or Enter

It has been tested on Mobile and Desktop.
